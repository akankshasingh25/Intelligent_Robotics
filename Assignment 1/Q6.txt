To Prove : Bug2 without memory is incomplete

We know: 
1. A path planning algorithm is incomplete when the robot is not able to reach the goal point in a finite amount of time. 
2. The bug is exited if the current hit point is re-encountered and there is no leave point found before that.

Prove by counterexample: An example showing that it never reaches a goal.

Proof:
Considering a scenario where there is a spiral obstacle.
Such that the robot hits the obstacle for the first time and then finds the first leave point. The obstacle is a spiral the robot will encounter the same hit point again in the path but since the bug has no memory, the same loop is executed indefinitely and is not exited.
