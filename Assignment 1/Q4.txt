To Prove : Bug0 is incomplete

We know: A path planning algorithm is incomplete when the robot is not able to reach the goal point in a finite amount of time. 

Prove by counterexample: An example showing that it never reaches a goal.

Proof:
Consider a scenario where thereâ€™s one obstacle in a spiral shape. 
In such a case, the robot will hit the obstacle at different hit points on the same obstacle but leave at the same leave point. 
Hence, the robot will keep following the boundary of the obstacle, never reaching the goal. This example has been implemented in Q.2.
