## Mid Sem

1. In the Assignment 1, Q7, compute the total time required to cover all the cells.

2. Let T be the total time required to cover all the cells in Q1. Optimize the start location for the coverage
such that the time required to cover the area is T', where T'â‰¤ T.

3. For Q2 in the Assignment 1, implement a visibility graph and generate the shortest path on this graph.
Show that the path produced using visibility graph is less than bug 0.
Display visibility graph, shortest path and bug 0 path in different colors.

4. For Q3 environment modify the rectangular objects into circular objects and implement potential field
path planning with collision avoidance. Define all the parameters and their value. You are free to choose
the parameters.
Bonus: For the same environment, draw visibility graph and shortest path. Show the path length
difference 4 marks

5. For Q9 in Assignment 1, consider that you have 2 pursuers and 1 evader. Show that with two
pursuers the time to capture is less than in the assignment. You can resuse the environment from the
assignment and modify it accordingly.

6. How do you ensure that the 2 pursuers do not collide with each other?

7. Bonus: Implement A* algorithm for Q3.
